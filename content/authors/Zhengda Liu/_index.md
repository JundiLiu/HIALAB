I am Zhengda Liu, a Ph.D. student in Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering at Iowa State University. I hold an M.S. in Statistics and Data Science from the University of Wisconsin–Madison and a B.S. in Statistics from East China Normal University.

My research interests include human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning, human–vehicle/robot interaction algorithms, and modern statistical methods, with the ultimate goal of developing interpretable and impactful algorithms that enhance human–AI collaboration and benefit society.

I have also gained industry and research experience through internships as a Machine Learning/Reinforcement Learning Engineer (VWAP-based trading algorithms), a Database Analyst, and a Computer Vision Algorithm Engineer. These roles strengthened my practical skills in data-driven modeling and algorithm design.

Beyond academics, I enjoy playing basketball, fingerstyle guitar, and attending live concerts.
