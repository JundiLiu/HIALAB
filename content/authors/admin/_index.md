I am an Assistant Professor in Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering and Human-Computer Interaction at Iowa State University. Prior to this position, I was a postdoc in Industrial and Operations Engineering at the University of Michigan. I obtained my Ph.D. and M.S. in Industrial and Systems Engineering from the University of Washington, and my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My current research focuses on Interactive Reinforcement Learning, Human Factors with applications to customized vehicle automation and human-robot interaction, and developing algorithms and frameworks for trust-aware adaptive systems.

My long-term research interest is to build customized AI systems as trustworthy teammates to better collaborate with human users in complex decision-making tasks. Specifically, my work aims to design human-in-the-loop learning algorithms leveraging implicit and hidden human feedback to achieve transparent and responsive interaction without interrupting or intruding.
