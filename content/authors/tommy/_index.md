I am a PhD student and research assistant in the Human Factors program in Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering at Iowa State University. I attained my BISyE in Industrial and Systems Engineering at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, with a minor in Computer Science. I worked as an undergraduate research assistant at the [Human Factors Safety Laboratory](https://hfsl.umn.edu/) under the direction of [Prof. Nichole Morris](https://cse.umn.edu/me/nichole-morris).

My research interests include human-agent teaming, the role of social norms and cognition on human-automation interaction, and applying human factors knowledge to transportation.

I am interested in leveraging knowledge about human abilities and limitations and techniques from engineering and computer science to build technology and environments that suit the people who use them. Particularly, I am interested in how to measure hidden cognitive features like trust and mental models and how to apply this knowledge to adapt automation for the user.
