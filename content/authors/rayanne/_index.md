I am a Master's student in Industrial Engineering at Iowa State University. I completed my BS with this department fall 2024 as a concurrent student and am now a full time Master's student. I worked as an undergraduate research assistant in our department as an undergrad under Dr. Sigurdur Olafsson and his PH.D student Gaurav Arwade.

With research I am interested in learning more about how we are affected by the things around us, and how these things might better fit our needs. Specifically, I am interested in how AI chatbots other tools can impact our performance capabilities through different interactional factors.
