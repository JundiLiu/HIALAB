abstract: "This AAA Foundation report documents two studies that help drivers handle conditionally automated (Level 3) takeovers. Part one mines behavior and physiological markers that forecast takeover readiness, informing driver-state monitoring designs. Part two evaluates a gaze-guidance aid that steers attention toward hazards during handovers, reducing the chance of secondary collisions."
