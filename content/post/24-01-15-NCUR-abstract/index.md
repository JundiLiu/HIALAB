Our work on *Predicting and Optimizing Workersâ€™ Trust Toward Autonomous Vehicles in Manufacturing Plants* is accpeted for poster presentation at the National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR) 2024.

<!--more-->

This work investigated the interaction between Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) and Workers in large manufacturing plant. The perceived trustworthiness and risk will strongly affect on the worker's behavior including trajectory deviation and speed variation. Therefore, it is crucial to design adaptive AGV behaviors to account for user's trust. **Abbey Bold** and **Brian Reiss** are Undergraduate Research Assistant (URA) in this project to help with study design, implementation, and data analysis.
