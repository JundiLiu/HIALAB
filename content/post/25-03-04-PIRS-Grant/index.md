Our cross-college Iowa State team is featured in the [2025 Presidential Interdisciplinary Research Seed Grant](https://research.iastate.edu/2025/03/04/2025-presidential-interdisciplinary-research-seed-grants-awarded/) announcement for pioneering the use of robots and virtual reality to support social-emotional learning. <!--more-->

Faculty collaborators E.J. Bahng (School of Education), Bowen Weng (Computer Science), and Jundi Liu (Industrial Engineering) will combine immersive storytelling, VR, and human-robot engagement to help young learners practice empathy, collaboration, and other SEL skills. The story highlights how robots serve as cultural tools that spark curiosity and deepen emotional connectionsâ€”validating our vision for human-centered robotics in informal education spaces.
