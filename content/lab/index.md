      subtitle: 
      text: "Human-centered Interactive Autonomy (HIA) Lab leverages Human Factors research techniques,  human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning and trustworthy machine learning algorithms to design human-centered and trust-aware customized autonomy. We aim to answer two fundamental questions:
      
      1. **Can we model human cognition and behavior formally and holistically?**  
      

      > Human constantly provides implicit and hidden feedback while interacting with autonomous systems. It is crucial to leverage the multimodal human sensory data to formally define models that are generalizable and personalized.
      

      2. **Can we integrate human in the loop?**
      
      
      > To build customized AI systems as trustworthy teammates to better collaborate with human users in complex decision-making tasks, we aim to integrate human in the framework to achieve transparent and responsive interaction without interrupting or intruding."
